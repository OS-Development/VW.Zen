The Zen Viewer is a v3 viewer based on the Second Life viewer-development
Snowstorm repository. It contains all the latest shines and fixes from the
SL community plus a consolidation of unique features specific to content
creation on the Second Life Grid.

In the past, this viewer has used pieces of code from other TPV viewers
and those people have never been (correctly) credited for their work:

Chalice Yao
Ima Mechanique
Kitty Barnett
Kadah Coba
Zi Ree

As a Opensim/Aurora Developer, I think it's good to mention this to
anyone that forks or downloads this repository.
